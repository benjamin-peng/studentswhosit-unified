              description="Sydelle Bernstein was born and raised in 
              Connecticut and began Students Who Sit as a Sophomore at Duke University. Coming from a 
              long line of entrepreneurs, she lived, breathed and learned firsthand what it takes to run a successful 
              business. She began her first business selling slime in the halls of her middle school and proceeded to have two 
              successful startups in high school. At Duke, she is passionate about studying Innovation & Entrepreneurship, learning how 
              individuals think and studying malfunctions in the brain through studies in both Neuroscience and Psychology. Outside the classroom, 
              Sydelle works with children in the Durham public schools through the Jumpstart Program, is a member of Dukesâ€™ Women in Business club, 
              and is a Co-Founder of Students Who Sit. Beyond academics, Sydelle plays lacrosse, pick-up basketball and enjoys spending 
              time in nature. As one of six children, Sydelle is the ultimate team member. 
              Being part of athletic, business and educational teams with 
              continual give and take and  collaboration comes most naturally to her! "
